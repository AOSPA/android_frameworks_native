      "message": "Jake, can we know the reason why the fuck codes from leaked MIUI source are being used here?\nthe whole topic is filled with it, I don\u0027t think this is necessary at all.\n\nPlease stop this, I have already saw these memes since a long time\n1. https://gerrit.aospa.co/c/AOSPA/android_device_qcom_common/+/37420 Not all devices have 4.19 to support vABC\n2. https://gerrit.aospa.co/c/AOSPA/android_device_qcom_common/+/36310 why? also why does it is force pushed to nuke previous votes again and again?\n3. https://gerrit.aospa.co/c/AOSPA/android_frameworks_base/+/37264 Again here, doesn\u0027t this literally violates people\u0027s privacy as FLAG_SECURE is removed here?\n4. https://gerrit.aospa.co/c/AOSPA/android_packages_apps_Settings/+/37265 same reason as previous one\n5. https://gerrit.aospa.co/c/AOSPA/android_device_qcom_common/+/37041 ok\n6. https://gerrit.aospa.co/c/AOSPA/android_device_xiaomi_surya/+/36933 This flag is depreciated fyi, everyone else is nuking it and this guy adding it. Ref - https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_amlogic_gx-common/commit/6775295b3f278821eb45c842214748957e860140\n7. https://gerrit.aospa.co/c/AOSPA/android_device_qcom_common/+/36344 (read the threat in gerrit itself)\n8. There\u0027s alot more if you dig\n\nAlso I\u0027m letting AOSPA directors know that alot of times negative votes are removed via fpushes, I\u0027ve been a AOSPA user since years and I do want that AOSPA keeps code quality up to the mark",

      "message": "LOL, bro I literally marked in another commit that this was just for repopick. Also any other commit that was in a topic and hasn\u0027t been merged yet is certainly just for repopick, or until some future adjustment, everything given to Merge has certainly been reviewed LMAO",
